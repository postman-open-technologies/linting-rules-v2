title: Spectral Ruleset Test Suite
description: |
  A machine-readable description of tests to run to ensure a Spectral Ruleset or a subset
  or it works as intended. In its current version, the format only deals with
  rules, not aliases or extends.
  
  A single test suite file may or may not contain all of the tests for all rules contained
  in a ruleset. For maintainability and readability, it could be interesting that a test 
  suite focuses on a single rule, and so have as many test suite files as rules.
  Though it would be possible to split the tests of a single rule across test suite, it is
  not recommended to do so.
