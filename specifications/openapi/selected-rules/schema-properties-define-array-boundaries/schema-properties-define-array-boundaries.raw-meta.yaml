        This is a Spectral governance rule to enforce that arrays in an OpenAPI
        always have minimum and maximum boundaries define, preventing these
        properties from being overloaded. Here is a JSON version of the rule
        that can be applied using this API-driven collection API, or at CLI or
        CI/CD pipeline.

        One or more schema objects in your API schema's components object has an
        array type property but doesn't define minItem or maxItem.
      fixDescription: >-
        Defining the minimum and maximum boundaries for arrays in your API
        schema prevents this type of property from being overloaded. Make sure
        that properties that have array type in your API schema  have minItem
        and maxItem defined.
