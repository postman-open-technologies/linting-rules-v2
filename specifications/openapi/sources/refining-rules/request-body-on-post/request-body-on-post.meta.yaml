  While authorized by the HTTP protocol, a POST request without body often hides a design problem (RPC-like design).

  The v2-v3 comes with a strange behavior in v2 when there's a parameters list without body, 3 paths are
  found (method, parameter, first element). It seems to be caused by the allOf, no problem in v2 version
  which use a similar schema but with a level less (no oneOf).

    comment: the v2 of the was absolutely not working, just checking that in was query, header, path or body
