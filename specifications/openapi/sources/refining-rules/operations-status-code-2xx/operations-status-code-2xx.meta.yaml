name: operations-status-code-2xx
category: Operations
labels:
  - operation
  - operation-success
  - http-status-code
  - openapi-responses
reason: |
  Operations are expected to succeed and should return a 2xx success HTTP status code.
  It's only on very rare occasion that an operation won't return such a code. That can
  happen when a redirection is needed (3XX is returned).

      JSON Schema used to replace the 2xx status core function which has been removed in v6
      can probably be improved
