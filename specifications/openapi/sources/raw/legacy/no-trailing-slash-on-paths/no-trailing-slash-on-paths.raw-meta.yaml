        One or more path item objects in your API schema's paths object have a
        trailing slash at the end of the path.
      fixDescription: >-
        Some tools treat a path that ends with a trailing slash (/path/)
        differently from way that they treat paths without a trailing slash
        (/path). To avoid any ambiguity, remove any trailing slashes from paths
        in your API schema's paths object.
